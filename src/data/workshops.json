    "description": "Join us for the first Data-Driven Materials Modeling Workshop, happening Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31. This three-day workshop will have a distinct theme for each day with expert speaker seminars in the mornings followed by hands-on workshop sessions in the afternoons. The morning session targets researchers—both experimental and computational—looking to integrate data-driven approaches into their projects and includes a keynote from a leading expert on the topic, followed by a talk highlighting developments within Hopkins. The hands-on session targets students looking to learn implementation details led by graduate students and postdocs.",
